00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.400
We add a quiz to the end of each
training module to assess

00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:06.800
whether or not your learner's
have retained the information

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.080
that was presented.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.940
Our quizzes contain anywhere from
three to 10 questions depending

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.620
on the length of the course.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.480
Learners can only complete the
module if they pass the quiz.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.913
If a learner does not pass the quiz,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.000
they will be given the option to 
either retake the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.880
quiz or retake the entire module.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.900
Let's take a one question quiz to try that

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.500
functionality within your LMS.

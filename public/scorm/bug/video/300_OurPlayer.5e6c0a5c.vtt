00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.620
Based on lessons learned and client
feedback, we redesigned our player

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.080
to include a more modern design
and a better user experience.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.940
While our training modules are bundled
into a SCORM package they do not

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.400
only rely on SCORM calls to
communicate with the LMS.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.980
They also use local storage as a backup
in case of SCORM API failure.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.940
The learner's preferences are also
saved locally so they do not need

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.260
to adjust settings for every
module they are assigned.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.720
We strive to have our content as
accessible as possible.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.780
Therefore, our interactive activities,
knowledge checks, or quizzes

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.580
no longer include audio.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.440
We use knowledge checks throughout
our modules to make sure your

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.180
learners not only understand the
content and concepts, but also

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.780
to keep them engaged and to make
sure the information is sinking in.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.920
In fact, this page is an example of the
type of interactivity we use often

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.300
because it allows us to effectively
break content up into more

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.440
digestible chunks of information.
